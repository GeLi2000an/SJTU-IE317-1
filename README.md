# Requirements
python3

Opencv-python

numpy

# Question_1
basic DCT and DFT transforms and their reversals

    cd question_1
    python test.py -method="DFT" -theme="QiuShuzhen"
you can also change method by typing `-method="DCT"`and change theme by typing `-theme="LinDan"`or`-theme="car"`

# Question_2
8*8 block DCT transforms and its reversal

    cd question_2
    python test.py

# Question_3
exchange magnitude and phase of two different images

    cd question_3
    python test.py
